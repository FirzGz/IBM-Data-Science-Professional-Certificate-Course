    "Machine Learning is the subfield of computer science that gives ?computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\" - Arthur Samuel\n",
    "\n",
    "Major machine learning techniques:\n",
    " - Regression/Estimation: Predicting continuous values\n",
    "     -> Ex: * Predicting things like price of a house base on its characteristics\n",
    "            * Estimate CO2 emssion from a car's engine\n",
    " - Classification: Predicting the item class/category of a case\n",
    "     -> Ex: * If a cell is benign or malignant, or whether or not a customer will churn\n",
    " - Clustering: Finding the structure of data; summarization\n",
    "     -> Ex: * Clustering groups of similar cases like find similar patients\n",
    "            * Can be used for customer segmentation in the banking field\n",
    " - Associations: Associating frequent co-occuring items/events\n",
    "     -> Ex: * Grocery items that are usually bought together by a particular customer\n",
    " - Anomaly detection: Discovering abnormal and unusual cases\n",
    "     -> Ex: * Used for credit card fraud detection\n",
    " - Sequence mining: Predicting next events; click-stream in website (Markov Model, HMM)\n",
    " - Dimension Reduction: Reducing the size of data (PCA)\n",
    " - Recommendation systems: Recommending items\n",
    "     -> Ex: Associates peooples' preferences with others who have similar tastes, and recommends new items to them, such as books or movies\n",

    "Difference between artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning\n",
    " - AI Components: Computer Vision, Language Processing, Creativity, Summarization, etc. -> make computers intelligent in order to mimic the cognitive functions of human\n",
    " - Machine Learning: Classification, Clustering, Neural Network, etc. -> branch of AI that covers the statistical part of artificial intelligent, teaches the computer to soolve problems by looking at hundreds or thousands of examples, learning from them, and then using that experience to solve the same problem in new situations\n",
    " - Revolution in ML: Deep Learning -> computer can actually learn and make intelligent decisions on their own, Deep learning involves a deeper level of automation in comparison with most machine learning algorthims\n",

    "#### Review:\n",
    " - Supervised Learning: \n",
    "     - Is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. \n",
    "     - It infers a function from labeled training data consiting of a set of training examples, can be used for mapping new examples\n",
    "     - Most widely used learning algorithms:\n",
    "         - Support Vector Machines (SVM) for Classification\n",

    "     \n",
    " - Unsupervised Learning:\n",
    "     - Is where only have input data X and no corresonding output variables\n",
    "     - The goal is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data\n",
    "     - Most Widely used learning algorithms:\n",

    " - Semi-Supervised Learning:\n",
    "     - Is where having input data X and some of the data is labeled Y\n",
    "     - Problems sit between both supervised and unsupervised learning\n",
    "     - Can use supervised learning techniques to make best predictions for the unlabled data, feed that data back into the supervised learning algorithm as training data and use the model to make predictions on new unseen data\n",
    "     - Can use unsupervised learning techniques to discover and learn the structure in the input variables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python libraries for machine learning\n",
    " - NumPy: a math library to work with N-Dimensional arrays, enable to do computation efficiently and effectively (Ex usage: arrays, dictionaries, functions, datatypes)\n",
    " - SciPy: a collection of numerical algorithms and domain specific toolboxes, including signal processing, optimization, statistics, etc., high performance computation\n",
    " - Matplotlib: provides 2D plotting, awa 3D plotting\n",
    " - Pandas: high level library provides high performance, easy to use data structures, has many functions for data importing, manipulation and analysis, offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and timeseries\n",
    " - __Scikit Learn__: a collection of algorithm and tools for machine learning, has most with the Classification, Regression and Clustering algorithms, designed to work with Python numerical and scientific libraries: NumPy and SciPy, includes very good documentation, less Python code. Most of the tasks need to be done in a machine learning pipeline are implemented already in Scikit Learn including pre-processing of data, feature selection, feature extraction, train test splitting, defining the algorithms, fitting models, tuning parameters, prediction, evaluation and exporting the model\n",
