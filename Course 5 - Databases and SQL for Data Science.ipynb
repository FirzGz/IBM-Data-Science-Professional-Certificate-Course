    "## Introduction to Databases  \n",
    "### Target:  \n",
    " * Be able to discuss SQL basics and explain aspects of the relational database model  \n",
    " * Describe SQL, data, database, relational database\n",
    " * List 5 basic SQL commands\n",
    " \n",
    "#### What is SQL?\n",
    " * A language used for relational databases\n",
    " * Query data or get data outta a database\n",
    " * Aka Structured English Query Language\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### What is Data?\n",
    " * A collection of facts (words, numbers, pictures)\n",
    " * 1 of the most critical assets of any business\n",
    " * Used and collected practically everywhere\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### What is Database?\n",
    " * A repository aka a program that stores data\n",
    " * Provides the functionality for adding, modifying, querying stored data\n",
    " * Different kinds of databases of different requirements, store data in various forms \n",
    " * Data stored in tabular form (aka table, spreadsheet) is a relational database\n",
    " \n",
    "#### What is an RDBMS?\n",
    " * Aka Relational database management system\n",
    " * A set of software tools that controls the data (access, orgaination, storage, etc.)\n",
    " * Serves as the backbone of applications in many industries\n",
    " * For example: DB2 Warehouse on Cloud, DB2  Express-C, my SQL, Oracle Database\n",
    " \n",

    " --> Building blocks for SQL for data science\n",
    " \n",
    "## Relational Database Concepts\n",
    "### Target:\n",

    "#### Information Model vs Data Model\n",
    "![picture alt](https://image.ibb.co/i7wDQU/image.png)\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Type of Information Model: Hierachical\n",
    "![picture alt](https://image.ibb.co/hc3A5U/image.png)\n",
    "* Data is organized via tree structure\n",
    "* Root of the tree is parent node followed by child nodes\n",
    "* A child node __cannot__ have more than 1 parent\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relational Model\n",
    "![picture alt](https://image.ibb.co/hyNL5U/image.png \"Entity Relationship Diagram aka ERD\")\n",
    " * Most used data model\n",
    " * Allows for data independence\n",
    " * Data is stored in a table\n",
    " * ER (aka Entity Relationship) data model is an alternative to a relational data model\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Entity Relationship Model\n",
    "![picture alt](https://image.ibb.co/cPT4X9/image.png \"Entity is Rectangle, Attributes are Ovals\")\n",
    " * Used as a tool to design relational databases\n",
    " * Entities are objects that exist independently of any other entities in the database\n",
    " * Building blocks are Entities and Attribute:\n",
    "    - Entities have attributes, which are the data elements that characterize the entity\n",
    "    - Attributes tell about entity\n",
    "    - Each Entity becomes a table in the database\n",
    "![picture alt](https://image.ibb.co/ijQMvU/image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Building blocks\n",
    " * Entities sets, \n",
    " * Relationship sets, and\n",
    " * Crows foot notations\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Defining relationships between entities\n",
    "![picture_alt](https://image.ibb.co/mnDzFU/image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One-to-One Relationship\n",
    "![picture_alt](https://image.ibb.co/hPmapp/image.png \"The thick lines indicate each entity in the entity set is involved in at least one and esactly one relationship\")\n",
    " * Only entities are used in the relationship diagrams\n",
    " * Attributes are omitted because they can clutter the diagrams\n",
    " \n",
    "#### One-to-Many Relationship\n",
    "![picture_alt](https://image.ibb.co/gi5qN9/image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Many-to-Many Relationship\n",
    "![picture_alt](https://image.ibb.co/cp5bUp/image.png \"Each Entity in the entity set is participating in more than one relationship\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mapping Entities to Tables\n",
    "![picture_alt](https://image.ibb.co/fhC6Up/image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relational Model Concepts\n",
    " * Building blocks:\n",
    "     * Relation\n",
    "     * Set\n",
    " * Set:\n",
    "     * Unordered collection of distinct elements\n",
    "     * Items of same type\n",
    "     * No order and no duplicates\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relational Database\n",
    " * A set of relations\n",
    " * Relation = mathematical term for table\n",
    " * 2 parts:\n",
    "     * Relational Schema\n",
    "     * Relational Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relational Schema\n",
    " * Specifies: name of a relation, name and type of each column (attributes)\n",
    "![picture_alt](https://image.ibb.co/i7WfN9/image.png \"This constitutes the relational schema\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relational Instance\n",
    "![picture_alt](https://image.ibb.co/ieKaN9/image.png)\n",
    " * Relational instance: a table made up of attributes or columns\n",
    "     * Column = attributes = field\n",
    "     * Row = tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relation: Degree and Cardinality\n",
    "![picture_alt](https://image.ibb.co/jLAzh9/image.png \"Degree = Column = 6, Cardinality = Row = 5\")\n",
    " * Degree = the number of attributes in a relation\n",
    " * Cardinality = the number of tuples\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Create Schema\n",
    "A SQL schema is identified by a schema name, and includes a authorization identifier to indicate the user or account who owns the schema. Schema elements include tables, constraints, views, domains and other constructs that describe the schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "A schema is created using the CREATE SCHEMA statement. For example, we can create a schema called LIBRARY for this course:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE SCHEMA LIBRARY AUTHORIZATION ‘Robert’\n",
    "\n",
    "The data types used can be: numeric, character-string, bit-string, Boolean, DATE, timestamp, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CREATE TABLE Statement\n",
    "The CREATE TABLE statement includes these clauses:\n",
    "\n",
    "· DEFAULT\n",
    "\n",
    "· CHECK\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the DEFAULT clause in the CREATE TABLE statement to specify the default value for the database server to insert into a column when no explicit value for the column is specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the CHECK clause to designate conditions that must be met before data can be assigned to a column during an INSERT or UPDATE statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "During an insert or update, if the check constraint of a row evaluates to false, the database server returns an error. The database server does not return an error if a row evaluates to NULL for a check constraint. In some cases, you might want to use both a check constraint and a NOT NULL constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SELECT Statement\n",
    "The basic structure of the SELECT statement is formed from three clauses: SELECT, FROM and WHERE.\n",
    "\n",
    "<attribute list> is a list of attribute names whose values are to be retrieved by the query\n",
    "\n",
    "<table list> is a list of the relation names required to process the query\n",
    "\n",
    "<condition> is a conditional(Boolean) expression that identifies the tuples to be retrieved by the query\n",
    "\n",
    "In situations where you might want to use multiple IF-THEN-ELSE statements, you can often use a single SELECT statement instead. The SELECT statement allows a CLIST to select actions from a list of possible actions. An action consists of one or more statements or commands. The SELECT statement has the following syntax, ending with the END statement. You can use the SELECT statement with or without the initial test expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT [test expression]\n",
    "\n",
    "WHEN [expression1]\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "(action)\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "WHEN [expression2]\n",
    "\n",
    "WHEN [expression3]\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "[OTHERWISE]\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "(action)\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
